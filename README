Configuration repository structure
----------------------------------
The OPNFV CI deployment engine relies on the configuration directory/file
structure as described below.
This sructure is provided by a secure official OPNFV secured one to which only
jenkins and andmins have access to.
The reason that this configuration structure needs to be secure/hidden
is that there are security sensitive information in the various configuration
files.
The structure provides separation of concerns between configuration provided
by the installer projects, the collaboration/feature/plugin providers/projects.
the CI/CD owners (Releng/Functest) and the lab owners (Pharos).

Following configuration directory and file structure should be adheared to:

TOP
!
+--- labs
      !
      +---- lab-name-1
      !        !
      !        +---- pod-name-1
      !        !        !
      !        !        +---- fuel
